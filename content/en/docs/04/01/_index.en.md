title: 4.1 Ansible Playbooks - Variables and Loops
weight: 41
sectionnumber: 4.1
---

In this lab weâ€™ll start to use variables and loops.

### Task 1

* In your playbook `webserver.yml` you have two tasks for starting and enabling `httpd` and `firewalld`. Merge these 2 tasks into one.

{{% alert title="Tip" color="info" %}}
Remember `loop:` or `with_items:`
{{% /alert %}}

{{% details title="Solution Task 1" %}}

Delete the 2 tasks "start and enable \[httpd,firewalld\]". Add a new task with the following content:
```yaml
- name: start and enable services
  ansible.builtin.service:
    name: "{{ item }}"
    state: started
    enabled: true
  loop:
    - httpd
    - firewalld
```

{{% alert title="Tip" color="info" %}}
Make sure your indentations are correct!
Older versions of Ansible used `with_items` instead of `loop`
{{% /alert %}}

### Task 2

* In your playbook `webserver.yml`, ensure that that the package `firewalld` is installed. Do the installation of `httpd` and `firewalld` in one task. Do you really need to use a loop? Have a look at the description of Ansible's `dnf` module.

{{% details title="Solution Task 2" %}}
```yaml
tasks:
  - name: install httpd and firewalld
    ansible.builtin.dnf:
      name:
        - httpd
        - firewalld
      state: installed
```

{{% alert title="Tip" color="info" %}}
See [Ansible Docs - Dnf Module](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/modules/dnf_module.html)
{{% /alert %}}

{{% /details %}}

### Task 3

* Write a new playbook `motd.yml` which sets the content of `/etc/motd` on all servers to a custom text. Use the variable `motd_content` and the `copy` module with the option `content` containing the variable.

{{% details title="Solution Task 3" %}}
Content of `motd.yml`:

```yaml
---
- hosts: all
  become: true
  vars:
    motd_content: "Thi5 1s some r3ally stR4nge teXT!\n"
  tasks:
   - name: set content of /etc/motd
     copy:
       dest: /etc/motd
       content: "{{ motd_content }}"
```
```bash
ansible-playbook motd.yml
```

Take a look at what your playbook just did:

```bash
$ ssh -l ansible <node1-ip>
Last login: Fri Nov  1 14:16:08 2019 from 5-102-146-174.cust.cloudscale.ch
Thi5 1s some r3ally stR4nge teXT! # <-- it worked!
[ansible@node1 ~]$
```
{{% /details %}}

### Task 4

* Using the command line, overwrite the content of `motd` by providing the variable `motd_content` with a different value.
* Modify the content again, but use a `vars.yml` file.

{{% details title="Solution Task 4" %}}

```bash
$ ansible-playbook motd.yml --extra-vars motd_content="0th3r_5trang3_TExt"

$ ssh -l ansible <node1-ip>
Last login: Fri Nov  1 14:18:52 2019 from 5-102-146-174.cust.cloudscale.ch
0th3r_5trang3_TExt # <-- it worked
[ansible@node1 ~]$
```

```bash
$ cat vars.yml
---
motd_content: "st1ll m0r3 str4ng3 TexT!"
$ ansible-playbook motd.yml --extra-vars @vars.yml
```

Login via SSH again and check if the new text was set.
{{% /details %}}

### Task 5

* Set the `motd_content` from Task 4 using `group_vars` for `node1` and `host_vars` for `node2`.
* Make sure you remove the variable definition in `motd.yml`. Reason being it will have a higher priority.
* Limit the run to `node1` and `node2`.

{{% alert title="Tip" color="info" %}}
  Think about where you have to create the folders for your host and group variables
{{% /alert %}}

{{% details title="Solution Task 5" %}}

Your `motd.yml` should look something like this:

```yaml
---
- hosts: all
  become: true
  tasks:
    - name: set content of /etc/motd
      copy:
        dest: /etc/motd
        content: "{{ motd_content }}"
```

After creating the new directories and files you should have something similar to this:

```bash
$ cat inventory/group_vars/web.yml
---
motd_content: "This is a webserver\n"
$ cat inventory/host_vars/node2.yml
---
motd_content: "This is node2\n"
```

Run your playbook and check if the text was changed accordingly on the two nodes:

```bash
ansible-playbook motd.yml -l node1,node2

ansible web,node2 -a "cat /etc/motd"
```
{{% /details %}}

### Task 6

* Get a feeling for errors: Remove the quotes around the curly brackets and have a look at the output.

{{% details title="Solution Task 6" %}}
```yaml
---
- hosts: all
  become: true
  tasks:
    - name: set content of /etc/motd
      copy:
        dest: /etc/motd
        content: {{ motd_content }} #<-- missing quotes here
```
{{% /details %}}

### Task 7 (BONUS!)

* Create a playbook `takemehome.yml` that does the following:
  * Create a compressed archive containing all the content from your `/home/ansible/techlab/` folder
  * Don't include the subfolder `/home/ansible/techlab/awx` with all its content in the archive.
  * Compress the archive using any supported type of compression.
  * Ensure an archive is created even if the source is one single file.
  * Send this file via mail to your own email adress. Note that you have to have valid credentials for a smtp server. Put these credentials into a password file `password_file.yml`.
  * Run the playbook using the smtp password from the file `password_file.yml`
  * remove the password file `password_file.yml`

{{% alert title="Warning" color="warning" %}}
It's NOT secure to put the smtp password unencrypted in a file. We will learn in the labs about ansible-vault how to encrypt sensitive data in a secure way.
{{% /alert %}}

{{% details title="Solution Task 7" %}}
Write your SMTP Password to a file:
```bash
$ cat password_file.yml
password: "<my_secret_password>"

Create the playbook:
$ cat takemehome.yml
---
- hosts: localhost
  #vars_files:              # if the vars file is not provided here, you'll have to use it with
  #  - password_file.yml    # --extra-vars on cmdline as shown below
  tasks:
    - name: Create archive, excluding awx folder
      archive:
        path: /home/ansible/techlab/*
        dest: /home/ansible/techlab.tar.bz2
        exclude_path: /home/ansible/techlab/awx
        format: bz2
        force_archive: true
    - name: Send archive via email
      mail:
        host: smtp.puzzle.ch
        port: 587
        username: "tux.puzzler@puzzle.ch"
        password: "{{ password }}"
        secure: starttls
        sender: tux.puzzler@puzzle.ch
        to: bill.gates@gmail.com
        subject: Techlab stuff
        body: Sending my stuff home
        attach: /home/ansible/techlab.tar.bz2
      no_log: true
```
Run the playbook by using the SMTP password from the file created before. After the playbook was sent, delete the password file.
```bash
ansible-playbook takemehome.yml --extra-vars "@password_file.yml"
ansible-playbook takemehome.yml # if vars file provided in playbook
rm -f password_file.yml
```

### All done?

* Wow! Well done. :-)
