[AWX](https://github.com/ansible/awx) provides a web-based user interface, REST API, and task engine built on top of Ansible.
CIQ's [Ascender](https://ciq.com/products/ascender/) and Red Hat's [AAP](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/management/ansible) are based on AWX.

Since the installation of Ascender is the most convenient, we use Ascender.
