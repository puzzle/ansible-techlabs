### Task 2

* visit [Ansible Docs](https://docs.ansible.com/)
* visit [Ansible Docs - Modules by category](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/2.9/modules/modules_by_category.html)

{{% alert title="Note" color="primary" %}}
Starting from Ansible > 2.10 modules are shipped via collections. We will have a look at collections in [Chapter 8](../08). You'll find an overview of the most used collections on [Ansible Docs - Collection Index](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/index.html)

### Task 3 (Advanced)

* By installing the `ansible-doc` package you get a lot of additional documentation.
* Use your package-managers functionality to find out what files are installed with `dnf install ansible-doc`.
* Now find documentation about jinja2 on the controller.

{{% details title="Solution Task 3" %}}
One way to find a list of provided documentation:
```bash
dnf install -y yum-utils # (if needed)
repoquery ansible-doc -l
```

You can also search for files in `/usr/share/doc`:
```bash
ls -lahr /usr/share/doc/ | grep jinja2
```
