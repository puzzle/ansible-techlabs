During this we’ll learn how to write and use ansible roles.

### Task 1

- Create a directory `roles` in your techlab folder.
- Configure your ansible environment to use the `roles` folder as you did in a previous lab.

### Task 2

Write a `httpd` role in your new `roles` folder which does the
following:

- Install `httpd`, start its service and enable it to run on boot.
- Install `firewalld` and allow traffic for the services `http` and `https`.

### Task 3

- Modify your playbook `webserver.yml` to use your new `httpd` role. It should be run on all hosts in the `web` group.
- Run your playbook and check if everything went as expected.

### Task 4

Create a new role called `base`. It’s `main.yml` should import the
following taskfiles:


- `motd.yml`:
  - Use the variable `motd_content` to change the `/etc/motd` content to "This is a server\\n". Remember to move the template to correct location in the `roles` folder.

- `packages.yml` which has to install:
  - firewalld
  - yum-utils
  - dos2unix
  - emacs
  - vim

- Write a `prod.yml` playbook which:
  - Applies the `base` role to all servers
  - Only applies the `webserver` role to the group `web`


### Task 5

- Rewrite the `httpd` role to apply the `base` role each time it is used in a playbook (dependency).
- Remove the play to run `base` role on all hosts in the `prod.yml` playbook. Run the playbook and see if role `base` was applied on hosts in the `web` group as well.
